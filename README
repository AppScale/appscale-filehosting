AppScale FileHosting is a Google App Engine application that enables users to upload files and let Google host them for you. Of course, you should only upload files that you own - so don't upload illegal stuff!

At AppScale Systems, we use FileHosting to host http://download.appscale.com, so that users can download virtual machine images with AppScale pre-installed on them.

Features to come:
- Only enable a whitelist/regex of users to upload files
